                   the United Nations Childrenâ€™s Fund (UNICEF), and the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP),

                   socio-economic and health crisis. With the currency depreciation, price spikes, and subsidy removals, 
                   nine out of 10 Syrian refugee households were not able to afford essential goods and services that ensure 
                   minimum living standards, despite increasing humanitarian support`,
